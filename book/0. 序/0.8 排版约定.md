# 排版约定

为了便于阅读，本书使用一些排版约定。本节包含了一些排版格式的例子。


```input
./configure --prefix=/usr
```

除非另有说明，上述样式的文本应该按照所看到的内容完整地输入。这种样式也会用在解释性的段落中，用以指出引用了哪些命令。


某些情况下，逻辑上的行将会在行尾使用反斜线扩展为多个物理上的行。


```input
CC="gcc -B/usr/bin/" ../binutils-2.18/configure \
  --prefix=/tools --disable-nls --disable-werror
```

请注意，反斜线后必须紧跟一个换行符。其他空白符如制表符和空格将会产生不正确的结果。

```monospace
install-info: unknown option '--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir'
```

上述格式的文本（等宽文本）用于显示屏幕输出，通常是命令运行的结果。这种格式也用来显示文件名，例如 ```monospace /etc/ld.so.conf```

*强调*

This form of text is used for several purposes in the book. Its main purpose is to emphasize important points or items.

http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/

This format is used for hyperlinks both within the LFS community and to external pages. It includes HOWTOs, download locations, and websites.

```
cat > $LFS/etc/group << "EOF"
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
......
EOF
```

This format is used when creating configuration files. The first command tells the system to create the file $LFS/etc/group from whatever is typed on the following lines until the sequence End Of File (EOF) is encountered. Therefore, this entire section is generally typed as seen.

<REPLACED TEXT>

This format is used to encapsulate text that is not to be typed as seen or for copy-and-paste operations.

[OPTIONAL TEXT]

This format is used to encapsulate text that is optional.

passwd(5)

This format is used to refer to a specific manual (man) page. The number inside parentheses indicates a specific section inside the manuals. For example, passwd has two man pages. Per LFS installation instructions, those two man pages will be located at /usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1 and /usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5. When the book uses passwd(5) it is specifically referring to /usr/share/man/man5/passwd.5. man passwd will print the first man page it finds that matches “passwd”, which will be /usr/share/man/man1/passwd.1. For this example, you will need to run man 5 passwd in order to read the specific page being referred to. It should be noted that most man pages do not have duplicate page names in different sections. Therefore, man <program name> is generally sufficient.
